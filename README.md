# WebDev-Course-Management-System
Capstone Project

This project is designed for Teachers, Students and Parents to stay connected with updates and one another. The user Interface we will be able to view is the teachers interface where there are able to edit information about their student and the students class. They will also be able to view charts containing information about the students.

For this project I created it using Spring Boot as the back-end along with MySQL Workbench to create the database used hold and edit information about the students. I also used ReactJS for the front-end along with Recharts to display some of the student information.

There is some trouble getting the Add student component to display and I am also trying to resolve issue with the save button in the update employee component.
